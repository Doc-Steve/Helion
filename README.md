# Helion
Ambilight clone for windows written in Rust, meant to be used with an Arduino running [LEDstream](https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino/LEDstream).

Using the [DXGCap](https://github.com/bryal/DXGCap) library to capture the screen in Windows, this program analyzes the image and sends resulting LED data to the Arduino.



# Config
Helion supports configuration generated by [HyperCon](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/configuration).
Config must be located in the current working directory, which is same as where the .exe is located when not run from command line.

Notes about config sections:

* `Device`: `Output` is serial port to use, e.g. "COM2" on windows. `Baudrate` is rate to use when sending pixel buffer to Arduino, LEDstream expects this to be 115200. `Type` is not read, but must be one where `Output` and `Baudrate` fields exist.

* `Construction`: Led placement. Everything is read.

* `Image Process`: Led capture areas. Blackborder stuff not read.

* `Frame Grabber`: **REQUIRED**. `Width` and `Height` decides to what resolution frame is resized when analyzing colors, smaller is faster. If either is 0, use native resolution. `Interval` decides frame limit. 1/interval = FPS. 20ms (50fps) is good default.

* `Smoothing`: Nothing yet!

* `Colors`: Color transformations. Works: multiple transformations, custom led indices, Gamma, and Whitelvl.

There are no plans to add support for anything under the `External` tab. That stuff is really just for Raspberry Pis with XBMC and stuff.


# Building
Dependencies:
```
Helion
|-- DXGCap
|-- serial-rust
|   |-- serial-C
```

Only Windows is supported at this time, as DXGCap is Windows only and I have not yet added support for any linux screen capturing.

## Windows
While static linking would've been preferred, static libs doesn't play nice with windows and Rust.

1. Build DXGCap and serial-C as dlls
2. Place DXGCap.dll and serial_c.dll in project root.
3. `cargo build`
4. ???
5. Profit
