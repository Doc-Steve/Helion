# Helion
Ambilight clone for windows written in Rust, meant to be used with an Arduino running [LEDstream](https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino/LEDstream).

Using the [DXGCap](https://github.com/bryal/DXGCap) library to capture the screen in Windows, this program analyzes the image and sends resulting LED data to the Arduino.

Supports configuration generated by [HyperCon](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/configuration). ATM, only LED placement is read from config, but support for color transformation, and more, will be added in future revisions.
