# Helion
Ambilight clone for windows written in Rust, meant to be used with an Arduino running [LEDstream](https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino/LEDstream).

Using the [DXGCap](https://github.com/bryal/DXGCap) library to capture the screen in Windows, this program analyzes the image and sends resulting LED data to the Arduino.



# Config
Helion supports configuration generated by [HyperCon](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/configuration).
Config must be located in the current working directory, which is same as where the .exe is located when not run from command line.

What is read from config:

* The "Construction" section. Led placement.

# Building
Dependencies:
```
Helion
|-- DXGCap
|-- serial-rust
|   |-- serial-C
```

Only Windows is supported at this time, as DXGCap is Windows only and I have not yet added support for any linux screen capturing.

## Windows
While static linking would've been preferred, static libs doesn't play nice with windows and Rust.

1. Build DXGCap and serial-C as dlls
2. Place DXGCap.dll and serial_c.dll in project root.
3. `cargo build`
4. ???
5. Profit
